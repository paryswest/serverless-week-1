## About Me
Hello, my name is Parys West and this is my first time using any APIs of any variation as well as serverless functions such as Azure. I am hoping to refine the skills that I have already learned within HTML/CSS/JS as well as trying out some Node.Js, which I use already for my live-server when I practice code. I am a full time student, full time worker, a mother, and I also am an entrepreneur on the side, so yeah, I juggle A LOT of things. I have resiliency in spades however, so yeah, I'll be fine. I am excited in general because when I come out of this bootcamp, I will definitely be a better developer than I was before.

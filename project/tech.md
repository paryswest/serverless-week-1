   If I can somehow find a way for this to like not be in Java (or what ever language this is in) and turn it in to Javascript then I can use this. This is like the grand hall of apps. All of the information that I need is here, but yeah...foreign code language strikes again.       
    

### Packages/Libraries/Databases

**Name of Packages/Library/Database**
Node fetch

### Front-end Languages
Javascript
- To be honest, its LEGIT the only one that I know to a certain degree, so there's that 
- I'm still brainstorming, but JS will make my app work. JavaScript is the verb website wise of web applications, verbs are actions, ergo, JS will make my app do what it needs to do. 

*please note, that changes more than likely will come as time goes along*
